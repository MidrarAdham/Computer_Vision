    "## Motivation\n",
    "* Optical flow is the pattern of motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene\n",
    "* It is a 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "Optical flow has many application domains:\n",
    "* Structure from motion\n",
    "* Video compression\n",
    "* Video stabilization\n",
    "* Autonomous vehicles\n",
    "* Object detection and tracking"

    "It works on several assumptions:\n",
    "* The pixel intensities of an object do not change between consecutive frames\n",
    "* Neighbouring pixels have similar motion\n",
    "* It assumes that motion is smooth, which means that the motion of one object is not independent of the motion of its neighbours\n",

    "# Images as 3D objects\n",
    "* Previously we've talked about how although images are 2D arrays of pixels, they are better thought of as samples from a continuous image surface: $I(x, y)$\n",
    "* We've also talked about other dimensions that we could consider such as\n",

    "    * Color\n",
    "    * Time\n",
    "* For now, we'll focus on the time dimension\n",

    "* The object is also moving through the frame over time\n",
    "* Suppose our object moves $(dx, dy)$ in a time interval of $dt$\n",
    "* Assuming the intensity doesn't change and the movement is purely translational, we can write the following equation:\n",

    "* It is based on the idea that the motion of an object is smooth and that the pixel intensities of an object do not change between consecutive frames\n",

    "Let's assume we wish to minize the $L_2$ norm of the error between one patch in a frame and a shifted patch in the next frame.
